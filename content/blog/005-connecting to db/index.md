So I've been working for a week (on and off) to get my code connecting to an external mysql server. And I finally, finally got it working tonight!

First I had to figure out how to connect to mysql, which wasn't actually too bad once I figured out the permissions. Then I had to figure out how to make a query, which I eventually got working.

But the really tough part for me was figuring out how to loop through results, one at a time, and list everything out. But I got it working! And if you look at the bottom of this blog post, you'll see a quick collection of songs from my fake band. Woo!
