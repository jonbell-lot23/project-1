This is sort of neat. I didn't think there was any way to have the git-driven CMS approach work. I thought when I renamed things, or wanted to move things, everything would fall apart. But that's not what happened. Which is pretty great.

The main thing I was concerned about was staging. I don't really understand how it worked, I'm just happy that it did. And if it's going to work that well, then I can move onto the next things I want to think about.

First, let's consider the steps that I need to go through each time:

1. Write stuff
2. Stage everything
3. Commit
4. And then I have to manually deploy ... or do I?

I'm going to commit this, but not manually deploy it. Then I'll wait for about 15 minutes and see what happened. Whether or not it goes automatically, I can turn my attention to next steps!
